I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working on some applied and theoretical projects with Professor [Kathryn Roeder](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and Professor [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/). 

I graduated from [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/), University of Washington. My dissertation supervisor was Professor [Noah Simon](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/noah-simon). Some educational stat [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYT3ZjN2VEOUosPoMPnI1-Q/featured) from him. Before graduate school I studied some biology and math in Beijing, China.

Some research keywords that catch my eyes: nonparametric + (regression/testing, among many others); model selection and [fine-mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study#Fine-mapping).
