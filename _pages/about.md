I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), Carnegie Mellon University, hosted by Dr [Kathryn Roeder](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/). 

I received my PhD (2022) from [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/), University of Washington. My dissertation advisor was Professor [Noah Simon](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/noah-simon). Before graduate school, I double-majored in biology and math at Peking University (2013-17). I also worked on business-motivated problems at Amazon and FOXO Technologies.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on scalable statistical learning methods that are mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient. Some research keywords that catch my eyes: nonparametric methods (basis expansion, reproducing kernel and shape-constrained); model selection (cross-validation and its variants); online estimation with streaming data. Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis (new questions and new methods), polygenic risk score (and related health disparity issues).

## Software

Most of my methodology works have a companion R package. I also mix in some C++ to improve the computational efficiency when needed. It is hard to keep the package information up-to-date in peer-reviewed publications so I list them here for your ease of reference.
