My research mainly focuses on scalable statistical learning methods that are mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), Carnegie Mellon University. I am engaged in both applied and theoretical research projects in collaboration with Professor [Kathryn Roeder](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and Professor [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/). 

I received my PhD (2022) from [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/), University of Washington. My dissertation advisor was Professor [Noah Simon](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/noah-simon). Before graduate school, I studied some biology and math at Peking University (2013-17).

Some research keywords that catch my eyes: nonparametric methods (especially those based on basis expansion and reproducing kernels); model selection (cross-validation and its variants); online estimation with stream data.
