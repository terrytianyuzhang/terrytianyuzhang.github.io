I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), Carnegie Mellon University, hosted by Dr. [Kathryn Roeder](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and Dr. [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/).

I received my PhD (2022) from [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/), University of Washington. My dissertation advisor was Dr. [Noah Simon](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/noah-simon). Before graduate school, I double-majored in biology and math at Peking University (2013-17). I also worked on business-motivated problems at Amazon and FOXO Technologies.

## Research Interests

Iâ€™m interested in developing statistical learning methods that are computationally scalable, grounded in solid theory, and robust in practice, including:

-   **Nonparametric methods** (e.g., basis expansions, reproducing kernels, and shape-constrained estimation)\
-   **Model selection techniques** (especially cross-validation and its variants)\
-   **Online estimation with streaming data**\
-   **Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis** (both novel scientific questions and methodological developments)

## Publications

A complete list of my publications is available in my [CV](/files/CV.pdf).

## Software

Most of my methodology works have a companion R package. I also mix in some C++ to improve the computational efficiency when needed. It is hard to keep the package information up-to-date in peer-reviewed publications so I list them here for your ease of reference.
